# Nanite on macOS

Brings the Nanite feature from Unreal Engine 5 to macOS.

## Usage

I have not added Nanite to UE5 yet; these steps show how far I am in development.

Prerequisites:
- Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
- Install Git. This can be accomplished using Homebrew: `brew install git`.
- Install Xcode 13<sup>1</sup> from the Mac App Store.
- Install Xcode 14 beta from [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/resources).
- [Create](https://www.epicgames.com/id/register) an Epic Games account and [link](https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/epic-accounts-c5719348850459/connect-accounts-c5719351300507/how-do-i-link-my-unreal-engine-account-with-my-github-account-a5720369784347) it to your GitHub account.

> <sup>1</sup>Xcode 14 should be released in September 2022. This information may become outdated soon.

<!--
To start, download Unreal Engine's GitHub repository. You must have an Epic Games account and access to the private GitHub organization. This can take an hour with average internet speeds, so minimize the amount of branches you pull. The command below only

```
git clone --single-branch -b ue5-main https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine
```
-->
