## Notes

Prerequisites:
- Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
- Install Git. This can be accomplished using Homebrew: `brew install git`.
- Install Xcode 13 from the Mac App Store.
- Install Xcode 14 beta from [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/resources).

<!--
To start, download Unreal Engine's GitHub repository. You must have an Epic Games account and access to the private GitHub organization. This can take an hour with average internet speeds, so minimize the amount of branches you pull. The command below only

```
git clone --single-branch -b ue5-main https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine
```
